# rs-blockchain

### WIP Blockchain package for the Rust programming language.

### It's API is still very unstable and should not be taken for granted. No documentation is available at the moment.

### To install this package insert this line to your Cargo.toml file

```toml
rs-blockchain = "0.1.0"
```
